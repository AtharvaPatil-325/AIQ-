Title: Satellite Data Pipeline for Space Agencies
Subtitle: Scalable, Fault-Tolerant, and Secure Software Engineering Solution
Date:15/9/25
Abstract: This report presents the design and functionality of a large-scale data pipeline for space agencies, focused on processing, storing, and delivering satellite data ranging from terabytes to petabytes. The pipeline ensures scalability, high availability, fault tolerance, and secure access for mission-critical applications such as disaster monitoring, agriculture, and climate research. Real-world case studies from the European Space Agency’s Copernicus programme and the ExtremeEarth project are discussed to highlight practical implementations.

Introduction
3.1 Background
Satellites generate massive amounts of data daily (TB–PB scale), including imagery, telemetry, and sensor readings. Efficient pipelines are required to handle ingestion, transformation, storage, and secure delivery of this data.
3.2 Problem Statement
A large-scale data pipeline designed to process, store, and deliver satellite data ranging from terabytes to petabytes. It ensures scalability, high availability, and fault tolerance for mission-critical space applications.
3.3 Objectives
•	Design a scalable, cloud-native pipeline for satellite data.
•	Provide high availability and reliability.
•	Ensure secure, role-based data access.
•	Enable distributed analytics for real-time insights.








Phases of the Pipeline:
4.1 Data Ingestion Layer
•	Captures raw satellite feeds in real-time.
•	Sources: satellites, ground stations, IoT devices.
Tools: 
•  Apache Flink (as consumer/processor) — pairs with Kafka for low-latency stream processing (if you need stateful streaming).
•  Google Cloud Pub/Sub — fully-managed global messaging for GCP environments (native BigQuery/Dataflow integration). 
•  AWS Kinesis / Kinesis Video Streams — AWS managed ingestion for time series / media; integrates with S3 + Lambda + SageMaker for downstream ML. Good if you run on AWS.
Pseudo code for ingesting satellite data
public class DataIngestion {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SatelliteFeed feed = new SatelliteFeed("Sentinel-2");
        
        while (feed.hasNextFrame()) {
            Frame data = feed.getNextFrame();
            
            // Push into Kafka (or any streaming queue)
            KafkaProducer producer = new KafkaProducer();
            producer.send("satellite-topic", data.toBytes());
            
            System.out.println("Ingested frame: " + data.getId());
        }
    }
}
4.2 Scalable Storage System
•	Stores TB–PB scale EO (Earth Observation) data.
•	Technologies: HDFS, Ceph, Amazon S3, CREODIAS object storage.
•	Metadata indexing for efficient search.
•	Hot vs. Cold storage tiers.
•	Tools: HopsFS (Hopsworks) — HDFS-compatible next-gen FS with erasure coding, NVMe caching and tiered storage for large ML workloads (used in ExtremeEarth / Hopsworks). Good for feature stores and ML workloads
Pseudo code for Scalable Storage System
public class StorageManager {
    private DistributedStorage storage;

    public StorageManager() {
        storage = new DistributedStorage("CREODIAS-ObjectStore");
    }

    public void save(Frame data) {
        String path = "/satellite/" + data.getTimestamp() + ".tif";
        storage.write(path, data.toBytes());
        System.out.println("Stored data at: " + path);
    }
}





4.3 Processing & Analytics Framework
•	Distributed/parallel computing (Spark, Flink, Hopsworks).
•	Operations:
o	Noise filtering
o	Image preprocessing
o	Data transformation
o	Machine learning (object detection, classification).
Pseudo code for distributed processing 
public class ImageProcessor {
    public void process(Frame data) {
        // Example: noise reduction
        Image img = ImageUtils.removeNoise(data.toImage());
        
        // Example: ML inference (object detection)
        MLModel model = MLModel.load("sea_ice_classifier");
        String result = model.predict(img);
        
        System.out.println("Processing result: " + result);
    }
}










4.4 Fault-Tolerant Architecture
•	Replication of data across nodes.
•	Checkpointing in ML/DL pipelines.
•	Automated recovery in case of failure.
